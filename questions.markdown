# FAQ about Virgil project

This page is a bunch of questions I've asked myself.

## SPICE
# Is this project related to SPICE?

The spice project also created by Red Hat is a remote virtualisation solution for the VDI space. It concentrates on remoting 2D rendering commands. This project is developed independently of SPICE and is not intended to replace it. Remoting 3D rendering using the techniques spice uses is not considered practical by the author, also the spice architecture relies on rendering capabilities in the server side that mean the same 3D gpu would be required on client and host side in order to guarantee the same results. This project is starting from a simpler place in order to build up knowledge of how 3D virtualisation can be done.
